# Senior-Sophestor-research
This is the code which was used for data anaysis of the OMNI dataset provided by NASA and the SC compact dataset provided by EBRE Observatory, as part of my senior sophistor physics and astrophysics research project for Trinity College Dublin. 
The data was analysised as part of research titled 'Assessing the Communication of Solar Wind Dynamic Pressure into the Near-Earth Environment' and is aiming to investigate the relationship between the geomagnetic indice SYM-H and the increased solar wind dynamic pressure during a positive sudden commencement event.
This research was conducted as part of the Magnetosphere group in DIAS, under the guidance of Dr. Alexandra Ruth Fogg and Dr. Caitriona M Jackman.
